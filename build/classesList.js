Jumps change which instruction will be executed next based on the value of a number. Memory accesses are exactly what they sound like, loading data from memory into the processor's local registers, and storing data from the local registers into more permanent memory."

Essentially, the long vowels all underwent raising - 'ee' sounds became 'ai' sounds, 'e' became 'ee', 'ah' became 'ei', and so on. Since spelling had already started to crystallize before this sound change, the spellings of many words no longer represented how they were pronounced, and this is (a part of) why English spelling is terrible."
