          I'm a software engineer with a strong attention to detail and a passion for figuring things out and teaching others. I have professional experience with Javascript (React, Backbone) and PHP (Yii), and have dabbled in Python (Django), but I'm up for learning just about any language or framework you can throw at me. I love working across the stack, and am comfortable writing a complex SQL query or diving into CSS. Besides programming, I'm enthusiastic about internet culture, linguistics, and teaching.
